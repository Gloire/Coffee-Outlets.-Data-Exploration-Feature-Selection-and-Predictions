# Coffee-Outlets.-Data-Exploration-Feature-Selection-and-Predictions

Start up restaurant chains tend to find it difficult to determine which outlet or product will be the least or most profitable. This is mostly because they tend to look at performance as a whole instead of looking at each individual outlet. Determining which outlet is more profitable (or most likely to become profitable in a short time) would help management to focus their investments on the outlets that are deserving, and if possible, close down or strategize on outlets that are consecutively posting losses.
